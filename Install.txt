This is the install file for the vps project with git actions deployment. This file is meant to be a guide to help install the project. You can use the website file provided or you can provide 
your own. This project is of moderate difficulty and may be too complex for first time Linux users. 

~STEP 0 - WHAT WILL YOU NEED?~
Aside from the files provided in the git directory, you may need to download, acquire or install a few things.
- A Linux system or virtual machine running Debian 11.
- Access to funds for the VPS and Domain registration service.
- GitHub (For easier in version control and software hosting)

Installing Linux on a system may be complicated for first time users. Below is a quick video that can be used to assist in installing:

~STEP 1-VPS AND DOMAIN REGISTRATION~
The first step in setting up will be to acquire a VPS and a domain name.

- VPS
For this project we used OVHcloud (https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/). They had fairly cheap rates for a VPS. We went for a fairly cheap one but if you want to get a VPS with beefier 
specs, it's up to you. For the purpose of the project, the minumum spec VPS did the trick. After finding a plan that fits your needs, you can purchase it. It may take some time to 
process. Once the transation has been processed, you will be provided with three important pieces of info:
- An IPv4 Address
- A Username
- A Password

- DOMAIN
We also used OVHcloud to register our domain for the sake of convenience. Simply search for a domain on the site of a service that offers domain registration until you find one that
is to your liking and available. You will also be given the option of a top-level domain We chose bestschedule.ca as our domain. Depending on your options, you may need to go through
some additional steps. As users of a .ca domain, we had to sign a registrant agreement with the CIRA (Canadian Internet Registration Authority) before our domain could be processed.

-POINTING DOMAIN TO VPS
Now that both are registered, log into your domain service's website and look for a your DNS settings. From there two DNS records of type A.
- Hostname: @		Points to: *IPv4 address provided by VPS service*
- Hostname: www	        Points to: *IPv4 address provided by VPS service*

It will take some time before your DNS is propogated. In the meantime, you can use this website to track its propogation: https://dnschecker.org/

~STEP 2 - BASIC SERVER SETUP~

- SSH
Now that your VPS and domain are set up, open your linux machine if you aren't currently using it. Open the terminal. Use the $ sudo apt update and  $ sudo apt upgrade to make sure
all of your services are up to date. Next, you will have to use ssh to get into your VPS. If it isn't installed, you can install it using the $ sudo apt install openssh-server
command. To get into your vps, use the command as follows: ssh *username provided by VPS service*@*IPv4 provided by VPS service*, then log in using the provided password.

- INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING APACHE2
The next step in setting up the server will be to install APACHE2. To install, use the command $ sudo apt update, and $ sudo apt install apache2. Next, you will want to navigate to
Apache2's files which should be located in the following directory: /etc/apache2/sites-available (use command $ cd). Use an editor like vim or nano to add the following lines to the
file called 000-default.conf. Between DocumentRoot and ErrorLog add the following lines:
- ServerName *Your website name*.*top level domain*
- ServerAlias www.*Your website name*.*top level domain*

You may need to change the permissions of the file to allow saving (use the $ chmod command).

Save the document. Start Apache2 using the command sudo systemctl start apache2. After the updates are processed and the DNS propogated, entering the domain in an internet browser
should yield the Apache2 default page, meaning your server is up.

~STEP 3 - SECURITY SETUP~
You will need to install some security next.

- FAIL2BAN
To install fail2ban, use the command $ sudo apt install fail2ban. Using it is as simple as using the commands $ systemctl start fail2ban, and $ systemctl enable fail2ban.

- MOD_EVASIVE
To install mod_evasive, use the command $ sudo apt install libapache2-mod-evasive. To configure it, go to the directory /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/evasive.conf and edit the file
by repacing *you@yourdomain.com* with your actual email. You must also remove the comment tags (#) from the follwing entries:
- DOSHashTableSize 3097
- DOSPageCount 2
- DOSSiteCount 50
- DOSPageInterval 1
- DOSSiteInterval 1
- DOSBlockingPeriod 10
- DOSEmailNotify mail@yourdomain.com
- DOSLogDir "/var/log/apache2/"

Save and reload Apache2 (sudo systemctl restart apache2).

- FIREWALL
We used iptables as our firewall. Use the command $ sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent. Then use the command $ sudo systemctl enable iptables, to activate it.

~STEP 4 - SETTING UP GITHUB ACTIONS AND THE SCRIPT~
Set up a github repository and add this project's files into it. Push it.

- GENERATING AN SSH KEY
To set up the script, you will have to generate an ssh key. To do that, you enter $ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa in the terminal. Continue to press enter for default options. Coppy the
contents of the resulting key and move to the next step.

- GITHUB SECRETS
Go into your repository's settings. Under 'Secrets', select actions and click 'New repository secret'.
Add the following information:
Name: HOST	Value: *IPv4 address provided by VPS service*
Name: PORT	Value: *The port of your server (Default 22)*
Name: SSHKEY    Value: *Contents of the ssh key you copied*
Name: USERNAME	Value: *The server username (Default the username given by VPS service)*

- SELF HOSTED RUNNER
In the project settings, go to 'Actions', 'Runners', and click 'New self-hosted runner'. Choose Linux as the image and x64 as the architecture. You should now follow the instructions
given to you. Once you enter $ ./run.sh, the contents of the repository will be deployed to your server's website folder. The final step is to install the runner as a service by using\
the command (while in the runner's directory) $ sudo ./svc.sh install, and then activate it with $ sudo ./svc.sh start.
