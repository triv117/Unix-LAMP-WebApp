This project intends to use the LAMP stack model to host a web application. LAMP is a software stack that implements Linux, a web server, a database and a script language. The project will be using Debian as the Linux distribution, an Apache web server, MySQL databases, and PHP scripting language.

The website is intended to be a work/time management application by the likes of Trello. Our project will be using a VPS as a platform.

<h2>Considerations:</h2>

The biggest choice was between Debian and Ubuntu as a distribution for the project.

We ultimately chose Debian as our distribution because of its lightweight nature and stability. It is also the distribution our team is the most familiar with.
