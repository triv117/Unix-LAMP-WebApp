# Unix-LAMP-WebApp
We intend to use the LAMP stack model to host a web application. The project will be using Debian as the Linux distribution, an Apache web server, MySQL databases, and PHP scripting language.
The biggest choice was between Debian and Ubuntu as a distribution for the project.

Debian Pros				Debian Cons
Stable and Secure		Smaller community
Easy to use				Slightly less user-friendly than Ubuntu
Lightweight	

Ubuntu Pros				Ubuntu Cons
Regular updates			Less server support
Better hardware support	Less stable
Large community	

We ultimately chose Debian as our distribution because of its lightweight nature and stability. It is also the distribution our team is the most familiar with.
-Our project will be using a server as a platform.
-Requirements: 
•	User Accounts: The website will use PHP and MySQL to manage and create user accounts.
•	Process/Service Management: Management will be done uniquely on the host’s side.
•	Security: Setting up a firewall as well as Fail2ban, Mod_security and Mod_evasive.
•	Automated Tasks: Mainly involve managing HTTP requests and web scraping. PHP scripting will be used for its ease of use with MySQL.
-The website is intended to be a work/time management application by the likes of Trello
-Timeline: 
•	Week 1: Setting up Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, running tests on server, VPS purchase, setting up Git.
•	Week 2: Basic server setup, setting up security services, writing PHP scripts and the HTML/CSS for the web application.
•	Week 3: Writing the scripts for automated processes and the account system.
-Team composition:
Tommy Rivard & Damiano Visalli
